# Focused Frontends

As websites and web applications grow in complexity and size, the old days of monolithic, site-wide stylesheets and scripts are over. I'll share with you some techniques for making your website more focused by modularizing your frontend code. The technologies I'll be using are LESS and RequireJS, but the principles should apply to any CSS preprocessor or JavaScript module library.

This talk was given during the 2013 [South Dakota Code Camp](http://southdakotacodecamp.net/).
